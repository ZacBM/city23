The part of the city known as the Central District is not actually located at the current city center, instead it is the oldest part of the city built around the massive lighthouse that guides ships to port and acts as the seat of power of the Magelord's. Many of the cities oldest families also have residences here, though they often only use them for buisness dealings. The district also contains a small port designated specifically for important arrivals and departures. This can include visitng diplomats, merchants of importance, or other similar visitors. The Central District has a fairly diverse population, though not as large or populated as other districts. People who live here often own buisness in the district or work in one of the government buildings dotted throughout. The buildings of the Central District are all almost as old as the city, having been built as people flocked to the lighthouse. These old buildings are made of a dark wood and large pieces of gray clay. In more recent years there have been efforts to bring more attention to the district by indicating points of local history with large posts and signs. This seems to be working for the time, though many of the non-governmental residents have been less than pleased with the influx of people to their neighborhood. While not lavishly wealthy, the people of the Central District tend to lead comfortable lives. Poorer folk of Joltayi say this is because the Magelords don't want to appear above the residents, though no public statement has been made from them.

People from the district tend to be fiercley proud of their Joltayi heritage, often adorning themselves with symbols and fashion of the city. They will talk the ear off of anyone willing to listen to their ramblings about the city and their family. Many of them also claim to be descendants of the founders of the city despite not having their family names. The founders descendants do remain in the city, though most have moved out of the Central District into larger villas to get away from prying questions.
