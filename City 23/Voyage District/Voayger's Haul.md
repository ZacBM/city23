1/8 - 1/14

Voyager's Haul is a large open-air market in the Voyage District. It is located close to some of the largest ports in the city, making it easy for traders to bring wares from their ships to be sold. The building itself has space for upwards of 40 stalls along the walls and gathered in the center, and the market itself spills out into the nearby streets. The building is made of a collection of planks salvaged from driftwood and decommisoned ships. The large walls of the building are filled with shutters  sellers can open to attract customers walking by. There is a mix of permanent vendors and open space to rent, with travelers changing as seasons pass and new trades open. The market helps contribute to the Voyage District being very popular among travelers as people come from far and wide to see what new wonders are avaliable.

	Grufeck is a stout and scarred dwarf, his dark skin pocked and damaged from years of working on the sea. He runs the Voyager's Haul with open arms and a strong will, making sure all sellers feel welcome while mainting a considerable amount of order int he hustle and bustle.

**Day 2 (1/9/23): Haulsgard**
	The haulsgard are a group of private guards hired by Grufeck to help keep the Haul running. Most of their day to day is similar to city guards, though they do deal with more magical thieves then others. They can be identified by the large maroon shoulder pad they where on their left side. They are currently captained by Zanick Thawn, a tall half-elf who wields a large glaive.

**Day 3 (1/10/23): Tradewinds Glory**
	Tradewinds Glory is one of the most popular vendors at the Voyager's Haul, commanding a large table along the eastern wall. They sell all manner of magical and mundane objects, with a specialty in unique magical trinkets. They are a permanent vendor, being supplied by a collection of  three ships that travel all around Vendaron. The stall is run by Hamatz, an old and scraggly sailor with coarse dark hair and a rough beard.

**Day 4 (1/11/23): Malzan's Mark**
	Malzan's Mark is a small blacksmith that has set up shop just across from the Voyager's Haul, as well as purchasing a small stand in the building itself. Malzan is a broad-shouldered earth genasi with shimmering obisidan skin and a specialty in magical weaponry. He tends to stay at the main shop where the most powerful weapons are kept, while his son Dura runs the stall in the haul. Malzan's wife, Brie, is also an earth genasi with long silver hair and piercing silver eyes.

**Day 5 (1/12/23): Grufeck's Quarters**
	Along with being the proprietor of the haul, Grufeck also has maintains a small set of rooms on the upper level of the market. Rumors have begun to spread of a hidden vault kept somewhere in these quarters, given credance by the strange Grufeck always wears around his neck. These rumors are only partially correct as they key does open a vault, they just get the location wrong. They key itself is a powerful magical item attuned to the elemental plane of earth and can open a gateway directly to a hidden location there.
