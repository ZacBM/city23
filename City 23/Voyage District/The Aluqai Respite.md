1/22 - 1/28

A massive four story inn located in the [[Voyage District]], the Aluqai Respite cuts an impressive figure amont the rest of the area. Located almost directly at the center of the district, the Aluqai Respite is often the first place new arrivals look when it comes to staying in the city.  While the Respite is quite popular, it also commands a steep price with rooms costing upwards of 3 gold a night. The place is very extravagently decorated, with ornateley embroidered rugs and furniture all around the lobby. A large bar stands on the left side of the lobby, a collection of colorfuly patterned glasses lining the shelves. The rooms are similarly well-decorated, with high quality bedsheets and an almost excessive amount of pillows on each bed. Rumors abound about how the place stays in buisness, though it employs so many people that most people don't care too much.

**Day 5 (1/26/23): Night Manager Daria**
	The current night manager of the Aluqai Respite cuts an imposing figure among the staff of the inn. Daria is a large lizardfolk who bares a striking resemblance to a komodo dragon, with tan-brown skin and large black eyes.

The night manager title is a bit of a misnomer, as the position mostly involves keeping charge of the private securtiy employed by Shine.
