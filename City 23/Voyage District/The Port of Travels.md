1/15 - 1/21

Located near the center of the Voyage District, the Port of Travels is the largest port in Joltayi. It takes up many city blocks, dominating the coastline of the city. Ships  traveling from near and far will often spend at least some time in the Port of Travels before heading to their true destination. There are a multitude of small shops and stalls along the boardwalk, making it very easy for new arrivlas to spend a day and all their coin just at the docks. The port also has a large collection of bakeries, food stalls and small bars to keep people fed and happy while they explore. This influx of travleres also makes the port a prime location for theives to make a living. Several of the more prominent shops and stalls are fronts for the cities more unsavory folk. The city is aware of these fronts, they simply choose to ignore as many of them bring prominent buisness to the city.

**Day 1 (1/15/23): Travler's Welcome** 
	A large festival held on the first day of summer and hosted by the Port of Travels, Traveler's Welcome is meant ot celebrate the height of the tourist season. Sellers from all across the city gather and set up stalls around the port and leading up to the [[Voayger's Haul]]. Many people around the city take a day off to peruse the market, making sure to be aware of their coin in the crowds.

**Day 2 (1/16/23): The Luckden**
	A small tavern and gambling den located near the edge of the Port of Travels. Despite it's small size it is often packed to the brim with people and kept remarkably clean. It is a well-known secret among the folks of Joltayi that the Luckden is one of many fronts for the cities underground. The bar is run by a short human man with short black hair named Saadi.

**Day 3 (1/17/23): Fikril's Fantastic Finds**
	Fikril's Fantastic Finds is a large curio shop located at the center of the Port of Travels in prime view of all arriving ships. A large enchated sign glows above the entrance, making it easily the most eye-catching shop in the area. Fikril himself is a gnomish man with long red hair wearing a well-made gold and green vest. He is a big personality but somehow still manages to draw people into his shop.

**Day 4 (1/18/23): Dockmasters Leri and Deri**
	Due to the sheer size of the Port of Travels, the city employs two dockmasters to keep things running. The current dockmasters are identical twin half-elves Leri and Deri, who take great joy in confusing newcomers and seasoned sailors alike. They have wavy, shoulder length blonde hair and bright green eyes alight with excitment. Frequent residents of the docks know that Leri watches the eastern half of the port, and Deri the western half.

**Day 5 (1/19/23): Down the Docks**
	A common phrase said by those of the Voyage District, saying someone is "down the docks" tend to mean they've met a gruesome end. People started saying the phrase after a string of bodies were found by a small exit tunnel under the far western edge of the port. While the killer was never found, people often attribute it to one of the major criminal gangs of the city.

**Day 6 (1/20/23): Kayrin, Wanderer of the Sulani**
	A thin and wiry man with unkempt blonde hair and very pale skin, people would not think Kayrin is in charge of a major crime syndicate. He is the current Wanderer based in the Sulani Peninsula and controls a large collection of criminals and connections all across the region. The Wanderers are a a group of major crime lords spread across the continent of Ibran, each in control of a different major region. Kayrin spends most of his time in the backrooms of the Luckden.

**Day 7 (1/21/23): Tradewinds Respite**
	Tradewinds Respite is a small inn near the center of the Port of Travels and is owned by the same people that run the [[Voayger's Haul|Tradewinds Glory]]. Many of the rooms are often taken by those who work on their collection of ships, but there is usually a few open for weary travelers looking to save some coin. The inn has a very small sitting room where patrons can order drinks or small meals, but it definitley isnt a full tavern and inn.
