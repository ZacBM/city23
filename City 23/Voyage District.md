Located to the east of the [[Central District]], the Voyage District is a hub of trade and activity for Joltayi. It boasts the largest ports in the city, and the [[Voayger's Haul]] draws people from all around the peninsula to peruse the rare goods. It is one of the most popular areas of the city for travlers due to it's abundant trade and many gorgeous sites. Large stretches of the ocean are avaliable to swim and fish in, along with some high-end resorts hosting private beaches and parties. The [[The Port of Travels||largest port in the city]] is also located in the Voyage District, so it is the first location many new arrivals visit in Joltayi. The Voyage District is one of the more wealthy districts of the cities as the influx of travlers lends itself to a large amount of commerce. Many of the more popular shops in the city maintain a small second location somewhere in the district, either along [[The Port of Travels]] or at the [[Voayger's Haul]]. The disrict also houses some of the larger taverns and inns of Joltayi, many of them touting the gorgeous views and proximity to the ocean as selling points. One of the most popular of these is [[The Aluqai Respite]], a large tavern and inn at the center of the district.
