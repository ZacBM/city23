12/18-12/24

The Fountain of the Architects is a magical fountain located in the Central District of Joltayi. The fountain constantly produces freshwater and feeds into smaller fountain all throughout the city. The fountain sits in the center of a large plaza outside the [[Magelord's Tower]] and is frequented by the people of the district. Shining golden runes are inlaid around the fountain, which itself shimmers in the sun as if made of opal. The statue atop the fountain depicts the three mages responsible for the construction of the lighthouse and are generally considered the founders of Joltayi. The are all depicted facing outward, each raising a staff or wand topped with a large crystal. The fountain itself was made many years later by a young wizard, who was then inducted into the Magelords. As one of the oldest still standing monuments in the city, the Fountain of the Architects is also frequented by people new to Joltayi. The city has started to capitilaize on this excitement, employing guides to lead private tours of the wonders of the city.

**Day 1 (12/18/22): The Inner Workings**
	To the general populace of Joltayi, the Fountain of the Architects seems to produce fresh, clean water from nothing. In reality, the fountain simply purifies the plentiful saltwater surrounding the city, magically ridding it of salt and bacteria. Only a few people in the city know this secret, including the Magelords

**Day 2 (12/19/22): Plaza Guide Jerrick**
	Jerrick is a young and personable half-orc who is currently working as a tour guide of sorts to the monuments of the Central District. He is always excited to tell travelers about the history of the city and who built what when, though he has been known to go off on tangents when he gets too excited.

**Day 3 (12/20/22): Statue Inscription**
	There is a plate on the fountain facing towards the lighthouse that reads "A gift to the founders and peoples of this city.  May it provide for Joltayi for as long as she stands and be a guiding light for her people." Under this, the names of the three people in the statue are written "Falkin Diathol, Amira Carillion, Shaydon Gem'tol"

**Day 4 (12/21/22): Bontra's Baubles**
	A small shop located on the western side of the plaza, Bontra's Baubles was started and is majority owned by [[Magelord's Tower|Bontra Carillion]]. They sell any random trinket you can think, bouth magical and mundane. The shop is very cluttered, though the people who work there always seem to know where everything is.

**Day 5 (12/22/22): Shaydon's Sanctum**
	A large white stone building located on the northeast side of the plaza, Shaydon's Sanctum stands in stark contrast to many of the other buildings in the area. The sanctum acts as a hub for learning in Joltayi, with many young mages starting their journey there. It was originally started by Shaydon and is still run by his family.

**Day 6 (12/23/22): Anna the town hermit**
	Anna is an older human woman who frequents the Fountain of the Architects, usually followed by a flock of seabirds she feeds. Most people don't pay her any mind, saying that she has been around for as long as they can remember. She and Jerrick have a good relationship and she often adds on little tidbits of knowledge to his tours.

**Day 7 (12/24/22): The Fountain's Light**
	The large crystals each of the statues hold above them occasionally catch the suns light, scattering rainbows onto the plaza below. Joltayin legends say that if all three crystals are lit by the sun at once a miracle will happen. What exactly the miracle is varies with each telling, some say a hidden chamber of treasure will open while others say it marks a new age of prosperity for the city.
