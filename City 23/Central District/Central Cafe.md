12/25-12/31

Central Cafe is a well known inn that sits a few blocks away from the [[Fountain of the Architects|main plaza]] of the Central District. It's a large establishment, taking up a full street corner and then some with all its rooms. Devrim opened it around 40 years ago and has been working hard to grow it to the notoriety it has now. The shop has garnered many patrons over the years and the people of the Central District are very protective of it. You'd be hard pressed to find a better cup of coffee and conversation anywhere else in the city. New travelers to the city often find themselves here by chance or reccomendation, taking Devrim up on his "Nomads Discount" and offering cheaper rooms for a night or two. Rumors travel quickly from the cafe and often these newcomers are offered work before the day is out, and Devrim is quick to note who accepts what. The cafe itself is a large 3-story wooden building, with a large wing off the ground floor. The main portion of the ground floor is taking up by the cafe proper, with a large bar counter in the back and many tables and booths around the room. The rentable rooms are spread around the building, some in the wing off the bottom and others on higher up floors. Typically the rooms on the third floor are more expensive, as they are larger and quieter than those closer to the cafe.
