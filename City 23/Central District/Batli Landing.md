1/1 - 1/7
Batli Landing is a small harbor located on the rocky shore below the [[Magelord's Tower]]. It is typically used to receive important or noteworthy visitors including the Magelords themselves. The dock is equipped to easily handle four ships of average size, one for each of the Magelords, and is able to accomodate one or two more if necessary. Dalion and Elanis both keep their ships hidden and accesible only to them most of the time, so there is often enough space to hold important visitors vessels. 

**Day 1 (1/1/23): Dockmaster Rohni**
	Dockmaster Rohni is a large tiefling with broad shoulders, deep red skin and short horns. They have clearly spent much of their life working outside on docks, their dark hair is short and slightly sun-bleached and they carry themselves confidently at work. They where a uniform of the city guard, though have little experience in live combat. They are extremley loyal to Joltayi and take their job as dockmaster very seriously.

**Day 2 (1/2/23): Dock Entrances**
	Batli Landing has two entrances from the shore, one public and one private. The public entrance winds around the cliffside and up into the city, giving a chance for visitors to see the city as the arrive. When speed and discretion is necessary, the Magelords can make use of a private exit built into the side of the clif directly. Inside is transport glyph that will immediatley take them to their floor in the [[Magelord's Tower|tower]].

**Day 3 (1/3/23): Lightkeeper's Shrine**
	At the far end of the dock from the public entrance lies a small cave carved out of the sea rocks. Inside a small yellow light can be seen night and day, slowly flickering like a flame. This small cave is the Lightkeeper's Shrine and is said to be where the founders of Joltayi first decided to settle the area. There is a large brass brazier in the center with a brightly glowing magical light shifting in the middle. This light is a magically created star, and maintaining it is the most important job of the [[Magelord's Tower|Lightkeeper]].

**Day 4 (1/4/23): Captain Tahir Diathol**
	Captain Tahir is a grizzled human man who looks to be in his early 50s, with dark hair flecked with silver. His posture is extremeley tight, adding to his already substantial height. He wears a well-kept uniform of the city guard as well as a large sigil of his house. He is the second-in-line to inherit the Diathol family, however he currently works as a captain to aid the Magelords whenever they travel by see.

**Day 5 (1/5/23): *Filament's Ire***
	*Filament's Ire* is [[Magelord's Tower|Rachnan's]] personal sea vessel and remains docked at Batli Landing most of the time. It is a large two-masted sailing ship, built to travel quickly through the waves and provide space for Rachnan to work. There are three levels of the ship, the third and lowest level is used as a workshop by Rachnan and his compatriots. Much of the ship has been reinforced with metal fortifiactions to protect from threats and, occasionally, problems arising from experiments.

**Day 6 (1/6/23): *Ahtifali***
	*Ahtifali* is [[Magelord's Tower|Bontra's]] sailing vessel and can often be seen traveling around the Sulani Peninsula or drifting in the sea a little ways off shore. It is a large three-masted ship with two large main layers and a small capatins room on the main deck. Bontra uses it most often to entertain guest, hosting lavish parties on the second deck's large ballroom. 

**Day 7 (1/7/23): Private Cargo Hold**
	Along with being a dock, Batli Landing is also where important or secret cargo is held. The location is a heavily guarded secret and only the most trusted members of the city guard. The hold is located under the waves, only accesible by a special key and passphrase. Recently Rachnan has been using it as a storage space for his prototypes and failed experiments, hoping to make use of them eventually.
