12/11 - 12/17

The Joltayi Magelords the ruling body of the city, operate out of a massive lighthouse that overlooks the water. Each floor of the lighthouse serves a specific purpose, with the first being a large reception hall as well as containing a magical elevator that can bring visitors to the lantern room.  Each member of the Magelords has a floor of the tower all to the selves that they may do whatever they want with. Most have some sort of office or meeting space as well as living quarters, though others use it as a place of learning. Other than the High Emininence, the Magelords choose their own title when they are inducted into the group. Most choose a title that refrence their chosen magics, though some have been known to make reference to their family or the part of the city they grew up in. The exact number of Magelords fluctuates over time, in recent decades the group has had 4 members. Members can change for a variety of reasons, from simple resignation all the way to a previous member passing. New members are chosen by a comittee containing representatives of the city and the current Magelords. Each representative then gets to elect someone they think worthy of the position, and these nominees are reviewed and voted on by the Magelords. Once the new member has been chosen, a grand induction ceremony is held during which the intiate is paraded through each district of the city before being brought to the tower. Many buisness offer grand sales, and people travel from all across the Sulani Peninsula to partake of the festivites.  The tower is adorned in massive banners representative of the newcomer, and a grand feast is held for all who wish to join.
